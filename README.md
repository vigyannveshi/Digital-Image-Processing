**_Special Thanks to:_**

- **_God_**, all the things I will and have learnt initiate and terminate from whom, who supports me in all my endeavours.
- **_Prof. Purti Savardekar, Goa Engineering College_**, my teacher in the course of Digital Image Processing. Most of the programs written are either a part of the practicals or implementations of things learnt in theory and practical.
- **_All my peers_**, in the course of Digital Image Processing for their active support.

## Disclaimer

The repository is created to share the concepts that I have been fortunate to learn in the Digital Image Processing course. I hope it  helps DIP enthusiasts in their journey. All programs have been written in python. The experiments are implementations of concepts. Most of the concepts have been tried to be implemented from scratch to understand the underlying nitti-grittis and have been combined into classes for better code organization and access. Rest of them have been inherited from existing image processing libraries in python to avoid reinventing the wheel unnecessarily. Images used in the experiments are taken from reference:https://www.imageprocessingplace.com/DIP-3E/dip3e_book_images_downloads.htm
and are used only for study purposes.
They are arranged  chapterwise in their respective folders.  All extra images used have been stored in the folder: **extra_images**, the input given and output generated are stored in folder: **input_output**, the concept related functions that have been created from scratch have been saved into their respective classes into folder: **important_classes**, and for easy access in programs have been imported into common file **dip_toolbox.py**. 
Everytime the repository being updated can be tracked using the featured image which depicts the **input_output** folder
